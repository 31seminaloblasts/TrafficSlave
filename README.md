This is primarily intended to predict the success of gas stations, but this also works to predict any business that solely relies on ease of access.

Given population points and location points in a situation where customers are soley dependent on the ease of access, this algorithm should be able to predict where customers go. 

I intend to expand this project to a prediction algorithm that maps the predicted revenue and potential revenue at locations that solely rely on ease of access.
