This is primarily intended to predict the success of gas stations, but this also works to predict any business that solely relies on ease of access.

Given population points and location points, this algorithm assigns population demand to locations based on travel time. 

I intend to expand this project to a prediction algorithm that maps the predicted revenue and potential revenue at locations that solely rely on ease of access.
